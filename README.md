[Hamilton, SWE Who Saved the Moon Landing] (https://interestingengineering.com/margaret-hamilton-software-engineer-who-saved-the-moon-landing)


Margaret Hamilton was the lead Software Engineer at the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory and the Apollo Space Missions.  It is very interesting how she
wrote the code by hand, and the papers would stack up to be as tall as her.  She was able to track errors and bugs throughout the thousands of pages of code
and effectively corrected them.  The code that she wrote ran successfully and the Apollo mission she wrote for was successful.
